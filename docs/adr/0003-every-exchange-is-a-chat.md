# Every exchange with the user is a chat

Users will not open a recap page in Notion, so v1's weekly Digest pages would go unread. So the agent talks to the user only in a chat. A Worker run that has something for the user sends a **Ping**: it alerts the user and ends its own chat with what it found, and the user answers in that same chat. A run pings only for Proposals on the Entries it just read (a grocery list for a recipe, a calendar event for a dated one; at most 5, the most urgent first) or for something only the user can fix. Otherwise it stays silent, except that after 7 days with no Ping it sends the Digest. The first time a kind of Proposal comes up, the agent asks for a **Preference** (always, ask me, never) and records it in the Settings. "Always" counts as a yes only for the user's own apps. Anything that reaches other people or costs money asks every time.

## Considered Options

- **Digest pages in the Library, with Proposals as checkboxes.** Each run wrote a dated page. Rejected: the user never looks there. Pages already written stay.
- **A recurring calendar event as the weekly reminder.** No tokens, but it only sends the user to go and look. Rejected.
- **Answering a Ping in any chat,** with each open offer written on its Entry. It works across devices, but it adds state to every Entry. Rejected for the same-chat rule.
- **No Ping.** The Library becomes one more graveyard. Rejected.

OpenClaw, xAI's Grok Bot and Claude Duet work the same way: they wake on a schedule, stay silent unless something clears a bar, and keep an approval gate that a stored preference does not remove (their docs, 2026-11-11).

## Consequences

- A scheduled run asks nothing while it works. At its end it waits in its chat for the user's replies.
- The Ping needs a way to reach the user, chosen at Setup: a push notification, an email to themselves, or a Notion mention. Tested on 2026-11-11: scheduled runs are never connected to Remote Control, and the tool that would connect one refuses unattended sessions. So a push from a run reaches only the computer, the run's chat does not show on the phone, and the user can answer only on the computer. Whether to let any chat answer the last Ping is an open question ([#2](https://github.com/andreadorizza/graveyard-killer/issues/2)).
- The Settings gain a Pings section (how to reach the user, Last Ping, Last Digest) and a Preferences table.
- Each Proposal is offered once, in the Ping of the run that reads its Entry. A Digest offers only Proposals about the Library itself, such as tidying or the Graveyard. In any chat the user can still ask for any action.
- A Proposal's result comes in the chat, or goes to another app on the user's yes.
